  <h1>B.Tech Journey 🌿</h1>
  <p>A simple, honest map from Class 11–12 to engineering life.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">

  <div class="intro-box">
    The B.Tech path is different for everyone. This map doesn’t tell you what you
    *should* do — it simply shows how students usually move from school to engineering,
    step by step, without pressure or hype.
  </div>

  <!-- Step 1 -->
  <div class="step-card">
    <h3>Step 1 — Class 11–12 (PCM / PCMB)</h3>
    <p>
      Most engineering aspirants choose PCM. Some take PCMB for flexibility.
      Physics and Maths matter for exams, but problem-solving matters more than rote learning.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Step 2 -->
  <div class="step-card">
    <h3>Step 2 — Entrance Exam Preparation</h3>
    <p>
      Students prepare for exams like JEE Main, JEE Advanced .
      Preparation may be through coaching, online classes, or self-study — there isn’t just one right path.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Step 3 -->
  <div class="step-card">
    <h3>Step 3 — Entrance Exams</h3>
    <p>
      Exams test Physics, Chemistry, and Maths with speed and accuracy.
      This phase feels stressful for many — consistency helps more than last-minute panic.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Step 4 -->
  <div class="step-card">
    <h3>Step 4 — Counselling & College Selection</h3>
    <p>
      Based on ranks, students choose IITs, NITs, IIITs, state colleges, or private universities.
      Both branch and college matter — but skills you build later matter even more.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Step 5 -->
  <div class="step-card">
    <h3>Step 5 — The 4-Year B.Tech Course</h3>
    <p>
      Branches include CSE, ECE, Mechanical, Civil, AI/DS, etc.
      You study subjects, do labs and mini-projects, make friends, and slowly discover what you actually like.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Step 6 -->
  <div class="step-card">
    <h3>Step 6 — Internships & Placements</h3>
    <p>
      From 3rd–4th year, focus shifts to internships, projects, coding practice and placements.
      Some students choose software roles, some core jobs, some higher studies like MBA/MS, and some start something of their own.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Hard truth -->
  <div class="step-card">
    <h3>One Honest Truth 🌼</h3>
    <p>
      B.Tech is not a guaranteed ticket to a job or a “package”.
      It is an opportunity — what you learn and build during it makes the real difference.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- <div class="step-card">
    <h3>Elder-Sibling Advice 💚</h3>
    <p>
      It’s okay if you are confused right now.
      You don’t have to figure out your whole life in college.
      Explore, learn slowly, take care of yourself — the rest will follow.
