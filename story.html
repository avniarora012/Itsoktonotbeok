      <h2>Still Finding Myself — and That’s Okay</h2>
      <p class="story-date">•November 2025</p>

      <p>I was an MBBS student once. For as long as I can remember, I thought medicine was my path — not because anyone pushed me into it, but because I wanted it for myself. But somewhere during my first year, I started to realize that maybe it wasn’t what I was meant to do.</p>

      <p>Whenever someone called me <em>“doc,”</em> it pinched me. I would smile on the outside, but deep down I felt guilty — like I was living someone else’s dream. I kept asking myself, <em>“Why am I doing this if it doesn’t feel right?”</em></p>

      <p>I tried to convince everyone that maybe this wasn’t for me, but my words didn’t land. To them, I was just another student going through stress — but to me, it felt deeper.</p>

      <p>One day, I stopped trying to explain and decided to take the hardest step of my life. I didn’t go to college. Instead, I told my parents that I was dropping out.</p>

      <blockquote>“Sometimes, walking away is the bravest thing you can do for yourself.”</blockquote>

      <p>The reaction wasn’t easy — there were scoldings, tears, anger, and disappointment. My family wasn’t on my side. But amidst all of it, I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time — peace. Because for once, I was making a decision for <strong>myself.</strong></p>

      <p>The truth is, I didn’t have all the answers back then. I didn’t know exactly <strong>why</strong> I wanted to quit. And I definitely didn’t know <strong>what</strong> I’d do after quitting. But that uncertainty didn’t stop me — it guided me.</p>

      <p>Everyone wanted me to go back and complete the year, but I didn’t cave in. I took a break — not to plan my future, but to simply <em>breathe.</em> I was sent to counselling, stress management, and career sessions, but nothing helped. I felt like no one could understand that sometimes, you don’t need fixing — you just need <em>time.</em></p>

      <p>So I gave myself that time. I started exploring — reading, learning, trying new hobbies, doing everything that helped me reconnect with who I was beneath all the noise.</p>

      <p>And that changed a lot in me. Although I still don’t know exactly <em>why</em> I quit, I can say this with certainty — that phase was necessary. It was the turning point that helped me understand myself better and become a stronger, more grounded version of who I am today.</p>

      <p>Even now, when someone mentions that phase of my life, it stings a little — like remembering an old heartbreak. But when I look at who I’ve become, I feel proud. That version of me who walked away had no idea where she was headed, but she trusted herself enough to start.</p>

     <p>It’s a strange feeling — watching others go ahead while your journey feels delayed. There’s a little guilt, a little fear, and a quiet voice that asks, <em>“Did I fall behind?”</em></p>

      <blockquote>“We’re not late — we’re just moving at our own pace.”</blockquote>

      <p>But over time, I’ve learned something important — life doesn’t run on one straight road. Everyone’s journey has its own turns, pauses, and redirections. We’re not late. We’re just moving at our own pace.</p>

      <p>There’s no timeline to healing, no expiry date on starting over, and no shame in taking time to understand yourself before rushing ahead.</p>

      <p>This is <em>my</em> story — not slower, not lesser — just mine. And I’ve realized that peace comes not from catching up with others, but from walking your path without regret.</p>

      <p>Today, I’m pursuing my B.Tech from a reputed college. Yes, I’m an engineer now — still exploring, still learning, still evolving.</p>

      <p>Life never stops teaching, and I’ve learned that we should never stop exploring ourselves.</p>

      <blockquote>“If you ever find yourself standing at a crossroad, unsure and scared — take the step that feels right for you.”</blockquote>

      <p>Even if no one understands it right now, trust me — one day, you’ll look back and thank yourself for being brave enough to begin again. 💜</p>

        <p>This story isn’t about giving up — it’s about choosing peace over pressure.  
        If you’re standing at the edge of a decision, scared and unsure,  
        I hope my journey reminds you that it’s okay to start over.  
        You’re not behind. You’re becoming. 🌿</p>
