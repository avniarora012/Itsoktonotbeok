    B.Tech is not just a degree — it’s a mix of excitement, pressure, comparison,
    growth, late-night coding, friendships, and self-doubt. These experiences are
    shared so you know you are not the only one figuring things out slowly.

      <p>
        The efforts you have to make to understand courses that you are not interested in, especially when u are an electronics student and not interested in core subjects ,the time and efforts you have to put in grinding dsa and cp (needed from freshers) when the actual thing that matters more in corporate is skills related to projects etc though dsa actually helps you but not really prepares you for the corporate.

    <h3>“Curiosity brought me here — now discipline keeps me going.”</h3>

    <p>
      I’ve always been that kid who’s super into tech, kinda obsessed with how the apps we use every day are actually built. I used to wonder if I’d ever be able to create something like that myself someday. That curiosity basically pushed me to explore the right path and figure out what I need to learn to make it happen in the future.

      <p>
       Umm about my day.. it actually varies a lot based upon a lot of factors, but here is how my typical day looks like. 
I am not a night owl, so i prefer waking up and starting my day early. First thing i do after breakfast is attempting leetcode POTD. If i have early morning class, i rush to it, else i solve some dsa/cp problems in the first half of my day. In second half, if there is no class or lab or any assignment pending, i either solve dsa/cp problem or work on my running project or learn technology needed for my project. 
In evening, i prefer going on a walk with my friends. At night either i chill or study for sem exam (during mid and end sems) or give contest (if there is any cf or lc contest scheduled) or do my pending work. 
      </p>
      <H4>  One thing no one tells you about this career?  </H4>
      <p>
        Before coming to college, people made kinda misconception that once you get into iit/nit, you'll for sure get a good job. But only after actually spending some time in college i realised it's not that simple, you have to study properly, maintain decent cgpa, get good skills, in order to end up getting a good job. 
One more thing which i realised lately is, getting a first good job is not only about skills and cgpa, luck matters a lot more than we think.

    <h3>“Engineering wasn’t my decision — but I’m learning to live with it”</h3>

    <p>
      I’m doing B.Tech right now, but it wasn’t something I had always dreamed of. My parents pushed me toward engineering when I was in 10th–12th. Back then I didn’t fully understand what I wanted, so I agreed. Now I can see that I mostly just went with the flow.

       Discrimination. The term “discrimination” also exists in this field.. So always keep your sleeves folded and be ready to fight.. ;)

      <p>
    First year:
It felt like a 9-to-5 routine — college, assignments, a bit of open-source, learning development, and a lot of roaming around with friends.

Second year:
My focus shifted more toward DSA. I took a course and continued the same 9-to-5 pattern of college, assignments, and exploring new things around me.

Third year:
We officially entered the rat race for internships. My entire focus moved toward that — online assessments, contests, interviews — and still, a lot of hanging out with friends.

Two-month internship:
A mix of work and a lot of fun and randomness with friends during the internship period.

Fourth year:
The focus shifted to placements — online assessments, interviews, contests — less roaming around, and more exploration in new areas like ML, building ML models, and even writing a research paper

      <p>
       People often say that B.Tech is all about “timepass” – and yes, like any other course, there are relaxed phases.
But when it comes to internships and placements, it can quickly start feeling like a rat race and sometimes even a toxic environment.

The comparisons, constant discussion about packages, and pressure to “not fall behind” can get heavy.

What really makes a difference is the people around you.
If you keep a healthy, supportive friend circle, the journey becomes much smoother and you feel less alone.
