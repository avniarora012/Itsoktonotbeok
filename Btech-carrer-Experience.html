    B.Tech is not just a degree — it’s a mix of excitement, pressure, comparison,
    growth, late-night coding, friendships, and self-doubt. These experiences are
    shared so you know you are not the only one figuring things out slowly.

        The efforts you have to make to understand courses that you are not interested in, especially when u are an electronics student and not interested in core subjects ,the time and efforts you have to put in grinding dsa and cp (needed from freshers) when the actual thing that matters more in corporate is skills related to projects etc though dsa actually helps you but not really prepares you for the corporate.

    <h3>“I chose engineering because everyone else did — and then I had to find my own reason.”</h3>

    <p>
      Honestly, I didn’t choose B.Tech out of passion. It was the “default option”.
      The real journey started when I began exploring what I actually like inside engineering.

        At first, I felt lost in subjects that didn’t interest me.
        Slowly, I discovered I enjoyed coding and building small apps more than exam marks.<br><br>

        My biggest learning — it’s okay if you didn’t have a dream at 17.
        You are allowed to discover your interest during the degree.
