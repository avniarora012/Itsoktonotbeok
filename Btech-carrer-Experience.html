    B.Tech is not just a degree — it’s a mix of excitement, pressure, comparison,
    growth, late-night coding, friendships, and self-doubt. These experiences are
    shared so you know you are not the only one figuring things out slowly.

    <h3>“Some days I feel confident, some days I feel completely behind.”</h3>

    <p>
      In the first year, I felt like everyone else already knew coding and I was the only one still learning basics.
      Placements and DSA talks started very early and it was scary.
    </p>

        It took time to accept that not everyone starts at the same level.
        I began with small steps — one course, one project, one topic at a time.
        I stopped comparing myself to toppers and focused on progress.<br><br>

        Now I’m not perfect, but I’m improving. Engineering taught me this:
        you don’t need to know everything on day one — you just need to keep going.
      </p>

    <h3>“I chose engineering because everyone else did — and then I had to find my own reason.”</h3>

    <p>
      Honestly, I didn’t choose B.Tech out of passion. It was the “default option”.
      The real journey started when I began exploring what I actually like inside engineering.
    </p>

        At first, I felt lost in subjects that didn’t interest me.
        Slowly, I discovered I enjoyed coding and building small apps more than exam marks.<br><br>

        My biggest learning — it’s okay if you didn’t have a dream at 17.
        You are allowed to discover your interest during the degree.
