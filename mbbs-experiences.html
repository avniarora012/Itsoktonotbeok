    MBBS is not just a course — it’s an emotional and demanding journey.
    These are real, anonymous experiences shared so that you don’t feel alone
    if your path feels messy, heavy, or different from what you expected.

    <h3>“Reality is different from what I imagined.”</h3>

    <p>
      Answer is not as simple as it seems. Initially I was weak in Maths and after 10th
      I was sure I could study anything except Maths. Now I am here.

        My day depends on the department. Sometimes it’s too hectic,
        sometimes relaxing. In emergency night duty it feels like hell,
        but OPD is manageable.<br><br>

        One thing no one tells you is that the medical field feels saturated now.
        UG seats are increasing, but PG seats are limited. Many MBBS graduates
        are left waiting unless they clear NEET PG.<br><br>

        JRship is good, but it isn’t always a long-term solution.
        MBBS is rewarding, but mentally exhausting — you learn resilience the hard way.
