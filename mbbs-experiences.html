    MBBS is not just a course — it’s an emotional and demanding journey.

        <h4> What does your day look like </h4>
        My day depends on the department. Sometimes it’s too hectic,
        sometimes relaxing. In emergency night duty it feels like hell,
        but OPD is manageable.<br><br>
        <H4>One thing no one tells you about this carrer</H4>
        One thing no one tells you is that the medical field feels saturated now.
        UG seats are increasing, but PG seats are limited. Many MBBS graduates
        are left waiting unless they clear NEET PG.<br><br>

        JRship is good, but it isn’t always a long-term solution.
        MBBS is rewarding, but mentally exhausting — you learn resilience the hard way.

       Before joining MBBS, I imagined it would be all purpose and passion — saving lives, white coat pride, respect. But the reality is deeper and more mixed than that.

The first months were overwhelming — lectures, dissection halls, endless pages to study. The excitement of the white coat ceremony soon blended with long nights of reading and fatigue. There were days when the routine felt exhausting and I wondered if this was the right path.
        There are moments of joy — understanding a tough concept, bonding with friends in hostel, learning something new in clinical classes. But there are also days of stress, missed sleep, and struggling to balance health, study, and personal life
        This journey has taught me that being a medical student isn’t just about books. It’s about adapting to pressure, managing time, and caring for yourself just as you learn to care for others. Some days I feel proud of choosing this path, and some days I question if I can keep going — and I think that is part of the honest experience.
