    These are real experiences from students in different fields, shared just as they felt them — honestly, softly, and without pressure.

    <h3>“Reality is different from what I imagined.”</h3>

    <p>
      Answer is not as simple as it seems. Initially I was weak in Maths and after 10th
      I was sure I could study anything except Maths. Now I am here.

        My day depends on the department. Sometimes it’s hectic, sometimes relaxing.
        Emergency night duty feels like hell, but OPD is manageable.<br><br>

        No one tells you how saturated the field feels sometimes. UG seats increase,
        but PG seats are limited — so many MBBS graduates wait and struggle until
        they clear NEET PG.<br><br>

        JRship is good experience, but it doesn’t guarantee a future path.
        MBBS is meaningful, but also mentally exhausting — it teaches resilience.

    <h3>“Everyone looked confident. I wasn’t.”</h3>

    <p>
      First year felt like everyone else knew what they were doing.
      People were coding, talking about internships, DSA, packages…

        I thought something was wrong with me because I was still figuring things out.
        Slowly, I started small — one course, one project, one skill at a time.<br><br>

        What helped most wasn’t intelligence — it was consistency.
        You don’t need to have your life figured out in first year.
